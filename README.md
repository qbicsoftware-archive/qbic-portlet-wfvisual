# Workflow Visual
by Sven Fillinger

**Description**

Uses trace files produced by [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html#trace-report) and creates summary charts. The charts will give a quick overview of the usage of **CPU**, **RAM** and **WALLTIME** resources, and enables a more detailed fine tuning of a Nextflow workflow.
